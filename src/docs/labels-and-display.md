# Labels in Label Creator

The Labels feature in Label Creator is a key component designed to help you generate and organize printable labels for your inventory. This feature allows you to customize the information displayed on each label, ensuring that your labels meet your specific business or organizational needs.

## What Are Labels?

Labels are printable tags that contain selected information about items in your inventory, such as SKU, name, price, size, or any other key attributes. These labels can be attached to products for easy identification, pricing, or categorization.

## Customizing Label Content

Label Creator provides flexibility in selecting what information appears on each label. You can configure the following settings to tailor the labels to your requirements:

- **Identifier (e.g., SKU or barcode)**: The unique identifier for each product, ensuring easy tracking.
- **Name**: The product name, allowing for quick recognition.
- **Price**: Displaying the product’s price, which is especially useful for retail environments.
- **Size**: Including size details for items where dimensions or volume are relevant.

These options are configurable through the **Settings Form** in the dashboard. You can enable or disable specific fields based on what information you want on the labels.

## Viewing and Managing Labels

After uploading a data file and performing SKU searches, the matched items are displayed in a list. Each item in this list represents a label that can be printed. The displayed labels will include only the attributes you’ve selected in your settings.

### Features:

- **Dynamic Content**: Labels update automatically based on your configuration and the uploaded data.
- **Real-Time Updates**: As you add or remove items from the list, the labels are refreshed to reflect changes.
- **Preview Option**: Before printing, you can preview the labels to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Printing Labels

Once you have finalized your list of items, the labels can be sent to a printer for physical use. Here are some tips for successful label printing:

- Use compatible label sheets or thermal label printers for best results.
- Ensure the label dimensions align with your printing preferences.
- Double-check your label content before printing to avoid errors.

## Best Practices for Labels

To make the most out of the Labels feature, consider the following best practices:

1. **Consistent Format**: Use a standard format for labels across your inventory for a professional look.
2. **Clear Information**: Avoid overcrowding labels with unnecessary details. Focus on key attributes.
3. **Use Barcodes**: If your system supports it, include barcodes for quick scanning and tracking.
4. **Test Print**: Always do a test print to ensure labels align correctly with your printer and label sheets.
