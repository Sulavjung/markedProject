## Key Features

### **1. Customizable Labels**

The Label Creator offers flexibility in label design, letting users select which product attributes to display. Examples include:

- SKU or barcode for identification.
- Product name for easy recognition.
- Price for pricing labels.
- Size for size-specific items.

Users can toggle these attributes on or off through the settings form, ensuring the labels align with their specific needs.

### **2. Intelligent SKU-Based Filtering**

The application allows users to search for products by entering an SKU. This SKU-based filtering retrieves and displays only the matching items, reducing errors and saving time. It also ensures no duplicate SKUs are added to the label list by providing real-time error notifications.

### **3. Real-Time Feedback and Validation**

The Label Creator is built to enhance user experience with helpful notifications:

- Alerts for duplicate SKUs to avoid redundant entries.
- Error messages when an SKU is not found in the uploaded data.
- Seamless updates when new settings are applied to labels.

### **4. Simple Data Management**

Users can upload a JSON file containing product information, which is automatically parsed and stored in the application. This ensures all relevant data is available for label generation without requiring manual entry.

### **5. Seamless Integration with the Dashboard**

The Label Creator integrates directly with other components of the Dashboard, such as the settings form and label display. This interconnected approach ensures a smooth workflow, from uploading data to generating and viewing labels.

## How It Works

### **Step 1: Upload Product Data**

Users start by uploading a JSON file containing product details. The application parses this file and stores the data, making it accessible for label generation.

### **Step 2: Configure Label Settings**

Using the settings form, users define the attributes to display on labels. For example:

- If `showIdentifier` is enabled, the SKU or barcode is displayed.
- If `showPrice` is enabled, the price field is added to the label.

### **Step 3: Filter by SKU**

To create labels, users enter an SKU into the input field. The application searches the uploaded data for matching items and generates labels based on the configured settings.

### **Step 4: Generate and Display Labels**

The matched items are displayed as labels in real time. Users can review and print the labels as needed for their specific use cases.
