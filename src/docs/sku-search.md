# Using the SKU Search in Label Creator

The SKU Search feature is designed to make finding items in your inventory quick and efficient. By entering the SKU (or a unique identifier) into the search field, you can filter and display matching items based on your uploaded data file. This guide will help you understand how to use the feature effectively and improve your workflow by integrating a barcode reader.

## Searching for Items by SKU

The SKU Search feature allows you to identify specific products in your inventory and prepare them for label creation. Here's how to use it:

### Steps to Use the SKU Search:

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard** in Label Creator.
2. Locate the **Enter SKU** input field.
3. Type the SKU (or unique identifier) of the product you want to find.
4. Press the **Enter** key to search for the item.

The application will compare the entered SKU with the data from the uploaded file and display the matching item(s) in the list of printable labels.

### Important Notes:

- **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure that the SKU matches the exact case and format of the identifiers in your data file.
- **Avoid Duplicates**: If the SKU already exists in the list, the system will notify you to avoid duplicate entries.
- **Error Handling**: If no matching SKU is found, an error message will appear, prompting you to double-check your entry.

## Enhancing Efficiency with a Barcode Reader

Typing SKUs manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. A barcode reader can significantly enhance your efficiency and accuracy. With a barcode reader, you can scan the SKU directly from a barcode on the product, reducing the chances of typing errors and speeding up the process.

### Benefits of Using a Barcode Reader:

- **Speed**: Instantly scan product SKUs instead of typing them.
- **Accuracy**: Eliminate errors caused by manual input.
- **Convenience**: Easily handle a large number of products with minimal effort.

### Recommended Barcode Readers:

If you don't already own a barcode reader, here are some highly-rated options to consider:

1. **Honeywell Voyager 1250g**: A reliable handheld scanner with excellent performance.
2. **Zebra DS2208**: A popular choice for general-purpose barcode scanning.
3. **Inateck BCST-70**: Affordable and supports both 1D and 2D barcode scanning.

When purchasing a barcode reader, ensure that it supports the barcode types used by your products and is compatible with your device or system.

## Final Thoughts

The SKU Search feature, combined with the use of a barcode reader, is a powerful way to streamline your inventory management and label creation process. Whether youâ€™re managing a small inventory or handling a high volume of products, these tools will save you time and reduce errors.
