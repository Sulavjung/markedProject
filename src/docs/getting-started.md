# Getting Started with Label Creator

Welcome to the Label Creator documentation! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with the application and help you set it up to fit your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A working internet connection
- Access to the Label Creator app

## 1. Uploading a Data File

One of the first steps in using Label Creator is uploading your data file. The application supports JSON files, and they should contain the necessary product data such as SKU, price, size, and other relevant information.

### Steps to Upload a Data File:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section on the dashboard.
2. Click the **Upload Data File** button.
3. Select a `.json` file from your local storage.
4. The file will automatically be read and parsed, and its content will be displayed in the system.

Once the file is uploaded, the application will analyze the data and prepare it for use in the SKU search and label creation features.

## 2. Configuring Settings

After uploading your data file, you may need to configure the application settings to tailor it to your requirements. These settings help define which information will be shown on the labels and how the search feature operates.

### Steps to Configure Settings:

1. Go to the **Settings** section in the app.
2. Customize the following options:
   - **Show Identifier**: Choose whether the SKU or product code should be displayed on the label.
   - **Show Name**: Select if the product name should be shown.
   - **Show Price**: Decide whether the price of the item should appear on the label.
   - **Show Size**: Enable or disable the display of product size on the label.

These settings allow you to select the attributes you want to highlight for each item in your inventory, which will be shown on the label once generated.

## 3. Save the Settings

Once you have configured the settings to your liking, click **Save Settings** to apply them. The settings will persist across sessions, so you wonâ€™t have to reconfigure them unless you want to make changes.

Now you're all set up and ready to start using the Label Creator!
